# Automatic-Open-Close-Sign-SL
This script will change a sign to open when the owner of the object is on the parcel, and closed when the owner is not. Connected to the UUID of example images.
I'm open to people using this script on other objects and or with other textures.
This is available on the Second Life Marketplace on a mesh with simple textures [here](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Automatic-Immersive-Open-Closed-Sign/22943124).
