# Second Life Scripts

This is a collection of scripts to extend the capabilities of the game Second Life. This game has it's own programming language, [Liden Scripting Language](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal). Feel free to explore!

You can find many of these scripted in items listed for sale in my [Second Life Marketplace store](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/244066)
