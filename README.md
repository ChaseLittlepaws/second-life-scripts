# Second Life Scripts

This is a collection of scripts to extend the capabilities of the game Second Life. This game has it's own programming language, [Liden Scripting Language](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal). Feel free to explore! The [Christmas Magic](https://github.com/ChaseTramel/second-life-scripts/tree/main/Christmas-Magic-Scripts) is the most visually interesting project.

You can find many of these scripts in items listed for sale in my [Second Life Marketplace store](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/244066)
