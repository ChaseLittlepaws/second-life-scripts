Looking to add a little magic to your Christmas experience? Look no further!

- Christmas Magic Sparkle Hooves
These produce magical Christmas sparkles when flying. The sparkles are different for hovering versus moving. There are four to attach one to each hoof.

- Rudolf Blinking Red Nose
This adds a red glow and red light to your nose, which can compliment a red skin color if you've followed the TWI Deer Rudolf Reindeer Shape & Style Card, also available from Littlepaws The light is steady when you're on the ground, blinks slowly when you're hovering, and blinks quickly when you're flying.

- Reindeer Sounds Generator
This attaches to your chest to create sounds. It creates sleigh bell sounds when you're flying and hovering, but the hovering bells are slower and quieter than the active flying ones. It also produces reindeer walking sounds when you walk, and has replaced your bumper sounds with a quiet reindeer snort.
